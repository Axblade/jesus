h2. Installation

To install the application you first need to have "bundler":http://github.com/wycats/bundler installed on your machine.
Once that is done, clone the project in the directory of your choice.

    @git clone git://github.com/dmathieu/jesus.git@

Then you should install the dependencies.

    @gem bundle@

You now have Jesus available on your machine. Start your god process.
And start Jesus.

    @god -c /path/to/your/god.config@
    @rackup@

Note: Jesus and God should be started with the same user. Otherwise, Jesus won't be able to get access to the God informations.

Go to "localhot:9292":http://localhost:9292 to watch the process monitored by god.
